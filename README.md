### Code Organization
- **State Management System** - Modular game states (Intro, Character Select, Game)
- **Object-Oriented Design** - ES6 classes for game entities
- **Event-Driven Architecture** - Input handling and game events
- **Performance Optimized** - `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth 60fps
- **Efficient Rendering** - Object pooling for bullets, enemies, and particles

### Key Classes & Components
- **GameStateManager** - Handles state transitions and game flow
- **IntroState** - Welcome screen with instructions and power-up guide
- **CharacterSelectState** - Theme and spaceship selection system
- **Game Entities** - Player, bullets, enemies, particles, power-ups
- **Theme System** - Configurable visual themes with unique assets

## üé® Customization

### Adding New Themes
1. Define theme configuration in `THEME_CONFIGS`
2. Add theme-specific background drawing functions
3. Create spaceship sprite drawing functions
4. Update CSS for theme preview styles

### Adding New Power-ups
1. Define power-up configuration in game constants
2. Implement power-up effect logic
3. Add visual representation and UI elements
4. Update power-up guide in intro screen

### Modifying Game Balance
Key configuration constants in `game.js`:
- `INITIAL_ENEMY_SPAWN_RATE` - Starting enemy spawn interval
- `MIN_ENEMY_SPAWN_RATE` - Fastest enemy spawn rate
- `PLAYER_SPEED` - Player movement speed
- `BULLET_SPEED` - Bullet travel speed
- `SHOOT_COOLDOWN` - Minimum time between shots

## üîß Development

### Performance Considerations
- Uses `requestAnimationFrame` for optimal frame rate
- Efficient object pooling prevents memory leaks
- Canvas clearing with fade effects for visual trails
- Shadow/glow effects may impact performance on older devices

### Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers with HTML5 Canvas support
- ES6+ JavaScript features required
- Responsive design for various screen sizes
- Keyboard input support required

### Development Commands
```bash
# Start local development server
npm start

# Alternative server command
npm run serve

# Direct Python server
python -m http.server 8000
```

## üì± Responsive Design
